LaTex Editor is a lite and free latex editor extension for your browser.

With this add-on, you can open any ".tex" file and edit the code via the built-in editor. Moreover, you can compile the code and see the rendered document (HTML5) within the app (bottom section). Currently, the latex compiler only works for basic latex commands. For complex documents, you need to install a native latex application. Once a latex code is compiled you can click on the print button to print the document to .pdf format (via the print UI).

Note #1: this app uses CodeMirror (https://codemirror.net/) and LaTeX.js (https://github.com/michael-brade/LaTeX.js) open-source JavaScript libraries.
Note #2: you don't need to adjust any settings for this add-on, simply open any latex document and start working on it right away.

You can install this app as a PWA on your mobile device, moreover, it is available as a browser extension as-well-as a web application:
